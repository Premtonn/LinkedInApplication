# LinkedInApplication

Automation that applies to LinkedIn jobs for you.
This was a project that I worked on a while ago, because I was applying to a lot of jobs on LinkedIn, looking for a summer internship. So, I thought I could make my job
easier, by creating a Python automation that will apply to jobs that have the "Apply with LinkedIn" option. This made my process way easier, and allowed me to a apply,
to a lot more jobs then I first intended to. The automation was created by using ```Selenium WebDriver```.

### NOTE:
The variables ```EMAIL``` & ```PASSWORD``` need to be changed, in order for the program to run through, as I was using my Login details when I was using this automation,
so then I had to remove them from the code, before posting it here.
